## Status

- Todo: not started
- WIP: in progress
- Done: complete

## Spec structure

Keep each spec short and consistent:

```md
# Title without the iteration number

One sentence describing the goal.

## Key concept

One short paragraph explaining the main idea this iteration teaches.

## Requirements

- Observable behavior only.
- Include inherited behavior when it matters.

## Example

A runnable manual check, with the prompt, expected trace/output, and any important assertion.

## Pressure test

A concrete scenario that exposes the remaining weakness and explains why the next iteration is needed.
```

Guidelines:

- Do not duplicate the iteration number in the title; the filename and ledger already carry it.
- Use `## Key concept` to name the lesson, not the implementation steps.
- Use `## Example` as the manual check.
- Always include `## Pressure test` to explain why the next iteration is needed.
